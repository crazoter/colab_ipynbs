# colab_ipynbs
* This is a repository used mainly for storing `ipynb` files that have been shifted over to GitHub using "Save a copy in GitHub".
* The main purpose of this repository is to store and organize code from these mini-projects, which can serve as sources of code snippets. As such, these notebooks do not necessarily have any similarities to each other, nor is there an overarching project involved.

## Auto_Jigidi_verifier_for_Ozoxmas.ipynb
* A foray into setting up Selenium + Chromedriver on Google Colab for computer vision purposes (did you know you can use Selenium + Chrome to take screenshots of a webpage even though it's in headless mode?)
* Basic scale-invariant template matching and abit of pytesseract for OCR purposes.
